        <h2>Objective of Isolation</h2>
          <p>The main goal of my research was to take the mixed cultures I have been working on for over a year and begin to isolate the ciliates present. If a pure culture of ciliates can be obtained, the culture can be genome sequence to obtain the identity of what ciliates are present. Since these cultures have come from the marine waters where corals were being kept, it would be helpful to know what ciliates are present and thrive with corals present. This would further research on corals and how to prevent coral bleaching, as if circumstances in which corals thrive can be replicated in the wild, coral reefs can be saved. </p>

        <h2>Methods of Isolation</h2>

          <p>Isolation of ciliates from mixed cultures has not been done very often in lab research. Ciliates are also found in cultures with other microorganisms, such as: </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Diatoms</li>
            <li>Algae</li>
            <li>Amoebas</li>
          </ul>

          <p> These are all organisms that thrive in the same conditions as ciliates, making it nearly impossible to obtain a culture of pure ciliates. Therefore, methodology of isolating the ciliates from mixed cultures has not been thoroughly research. My methods were highly experimental and it took me numerous chances to find a method that worked.  </p>

          <h3>Pipetting Individual Ciliates</h3>
            <p>One method I attempted was to remove individual ciliates from a mixed culture and grow them in a flask on their own. I used the culture JDC11 that was mostly ciliates and put a couple of drops onto a slide. Using a high powered microscope, I could observe the ciliates up close on the slide. Using the smallest pipette available in the lab, I tried to take up only one or two ciliates at a time and put them in a flask of fresh medium. The goal was 10-15 ciliates from the slide for the flask. </p>

            <p>After letting these flasks grow for a week, they were observed again. It was found that this methodology came with many flaws. The ciliates are fast moving and any chemical that could be used to slow them would possibly kill them. Their fast pace made it difficult to pick up one without also picking up contaminants. The pipette that was available also proved to be too large. The pipette was so large that while it did pick up ciliates, it also picked up the contaminates present in the flask, such as the diatoms. These diatoms outcompeted the ciliates present, meaning that the cultures were not pure after all. </p>

          <h3>Filtration</h3>
            <p>A second method I employed was filtering the cultures. By putting a couple drops of the culture on a slide and placing it under a microscope, I was able to use a computer software to obtain pictures of the ciliates and diatoms. A software called Image J allowed for measurements of width to be taken for the ciliates and diatoms. </p>

            <p>I found that on average, the ciliates measured over 10 um where the diatoms were under 10 um. This drastic difference in size meant that the cultures could be filtered to separate the diatoms and the ciliates from each other. 10 um filters were placed on a vacuum suction and the culture poured over it. Using the vacuum, the liquid was sucked through. The filter would catch the ciliates while the diatoms would pass through. The filter containing the caught ciliates was placed in a flask containing fresh medium, then left to grow for the week. </p>

            <p>This method seemed to be a better option for isolating the ciliates. Since the majority of diatoms were smaller than the ciliates, they could be more easily separated. The few diatoms that were caught in the filter instead of passing through would be unable to outcompete the ciliates. To better the results, the new flasks were also placed in the dark as diatoms struggle to grow in the dark, whereas ciliates can survive. </p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>The pipetting method proved to be unsuccessful. However, filtration seemed to provide better results. While my experimenting and culturing is still ongoing, it seems filtration provided the best method for separating ciliates from the contaminants in the cultures. The cultures that were obtained from filtration appear to be mostly ciliates. The filtrations will continue to be done until the cultures are 100% ciliates and can be genome sequenced. </p>
