    <h1>Shea Halpenny</h1>
      <p> I am currently a senior at the University of Miami double majoring in Marine Sciences and Biology. While I live in Miami now, I am from Buffalo, NY, originally. If you're ever looking for a place to vacation in the winter season, Buffalo is not the place for you; it is a frozen, chilly place. I am currently 20 years old with my 21st birthday coming up in December. While I may be young, I have a lot about my life to share.</p>

    <h2>Family</h2>
      <p>I come from a large family compared to most people. My parents divorced when I was young, so I have siblings from both my dad and my stepdad. My family is consisted of:</p?
          <ul>
            <li>Ryan (my mom)</li>
            <li>Ricky (my dad) </li>
            <li>Dametri (my stepdad)</li>
            <li>Me (the oldest child)</li>
            <li>Reanne (my 17 year-old sister)</li>
            <li>Andrew (my 14 year-old brother)</li>
            <li>Dametri Jr. (my 6 year-old brother) </li>
            <li>Ray'sean (my other 6 year-old brother)</li>
          </ul>
      <p> Obviously, there is a big age gap between the oldest three kids and the youngest; my mom had twins with my stepdad a few years before they got married. While having twins (especially so much younger than me and my other siblings) was a difficult adjustment, they were a welcome addition to our family. They are chaotic, loud, and demanding but they are also so loving, hysterical, and know how to brighten anyone’s day. </p>

      <p>My sister was able to graduate high school this past June, a year ahead of schedule. She is currently on the hunt for colleges and I’m trying to pass on my sisterly wisdom to help her. My brother just started his freshman year of high school at a new school and is already excelling in his program. Being the oldest sibling to five is a lot of work. I had to mature quickly and had a huge part in raising my siblings due to my mother’s busy work schedule. While my childhood may not have been as easy-going as my friends’, I adore my siblings. They make me proud with all they do, and they bring so much light into my life. If I’m ever having a bad day, I have four people who are guaranteed to make me smile. </p>
