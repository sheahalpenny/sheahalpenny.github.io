        <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>As a senior at the University of Miami studying Marine Science and Biology, finding research experience in a lab was important to me. After finding a position in the del Campo microbiology lab, I was able to gain lab experience first hand. I have learned numerous skills like subculturing, lab cleaning, growing ciliates, and bettered my research abilities. After working in the lab for extended period of time, I finally began my own research project. </p>
