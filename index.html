    <h1>Shea Halpenny</h1>
      <p> I am currently a senior at the University of Miami double majoring in Marine Sciences and Biology. While I live in Miami now, I am from Buffalo, NY, originally. If you're ever looking for a place to vacation in the winter season, Buffalo is not the place for you; it is a frozen, chilly place. I am currently 20 years old with my 21st birthday coming up in December. While I may be young, I have a lot about my life to share.</p>
